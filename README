Games and Simulations for Teaching Wildlife Stats

BCSS is a Malaysia-based NGO that runs "Boot Camps" in wildlife study design and data analysis in South and Southeast Asia and occasionally as far away as Kazakhstan and China.

We include lots of data-generating games which simulate different types of data collection. The physical games involve rolling dice, shuffling cards, moving counters over a board or throwing socks into a box. These games and the interaction among participants that they engender is a key part of making the Boot Camps fun, and overcoming any reluctance to engage with statistics.

But the physical games require physical equipment: our Toy Box weighs almost 20kg. And it is a weak link in the chain. On the way back from a recent workshop in Thailand, the airline managed to lose the Toy Box (and our personal baggage). We were able to scrabble together another set before the next workshop, but had the loss occured on the way to a Boot Camp, we would have been stuck.

Hence the decision to develop a set of on-screen games and computer simulations to take the place of the physical games in an emergency. Having a virtual Toy Box available on-line will let us sleep better.
